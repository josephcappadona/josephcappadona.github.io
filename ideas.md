## Ideas

These are some ideas I would like to work on if I had funding:

* Automated Multimodal Knowledge Base Construction on Wikipedia, Wikidata, Wikimedia, Google Images, etc.
* Training Virtual Agents Using [Self-play](https://openai.com/blog/competitive-self-play/)
* Machine Reading Comprehension on [books3](http://the-eye.eu/public/AI/pile_preliminary_components/books3.tar.gz)
