## Ideas

These are some ideas I would like to work on if I had funding:

* Unsupervised Learning on YouTube and/or Twitch Data a la [VideoBERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01766)
* Automated Multimodal Knowledge Base Construction on Wikipedia, Wikidata, Wikimedia, Google Images, etc.
* Zero-shot Voice Recognition for Large Scale Speech-to-Text Pipelines a la [Cooper, Lai, et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10838)
* Training Virtual Agents Using [Self-play](https://openai.com/blog/competitive-self-play/)
* Machine Reading Comprehension on [books3](http://the-eye.eu/public/AI/pile_preliminary_components/books3.tar.gz)
