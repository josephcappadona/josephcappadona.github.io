      <p>Hello! My name is Joe and I'm a machine learning research engineer. Outside of my work, I love to play games of all varieties, but especially poker, chess, SSBM, and, as of late, volleyball. Eventually maybe I'll put here some pictures of me actually doing those things.</p>
      <p>I recently completed my MS in Computer Science at NYU, where I worked with <a href="https://cs.nyu.edu/~kgeras/">Krzysztof Geras</a> on applying self-supervised learning to 3D breast MRIs in order to build diagnostic and prognostic models for breast cancer.</p>
      <p>Currently, I am working at Ataraxis AI, where my primary responsibility is to train self-supervised digital pathology foundation models and apply them to survival tasks. Lately, we have been focusing on modeling breast cancer recurrence with the end goal of predicting response to treatment. You can read about our work modeling breast cancer recurrence <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21256">here</a>, and about our work building pathology foundation models <a href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66f22558f0bee9421463707b/6723001b306063d71f2b69c3_13_Squeezing_performance_from_%20(1).pdf">here</a>.</p>
      <p>Please feel free to check out my <a href="https://github.com/josephcappadona">GitHub</a>, where you will find many projects I've worked on, primarily revolving around machine learning and data engineering. Also feel free to check out my <a href="https://twitter.com/joecappadona">Twitter</a>, where you will find random thoughts that I for some reason or other decided to memorialize on the Internet.</p>
