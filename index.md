      <p>Hello! My name is Joe and I'm a machine learning research engineer.</p>
      <p>I recently completed my MS in Computer Science at NYU, specializing in machine learning. For my thesis, I worked with <a href="https://cs.nyu.edu/~kgeras/">Krzysztof Geras</a> on applying modern self-supervised learning techniques to 3D breast MRIs in order to build diagnostic and prognostic models for breast cancer.</p>
      <p>This website is a work in progress, but I encourage you to check out my <a href="https://github.com/josephcappadona">GitHub</a>, where you will find many projects I've worked on which primarily revolve around machine learning and web scraping.</p>
