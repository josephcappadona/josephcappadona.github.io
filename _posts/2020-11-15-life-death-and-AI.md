title: "Life, Death, and Artificial Intelligence"

---

I’ve thought a lot about why I want to study artificial intelligence. Looking back on my experiences in high school, it makes sense that I would wind up pursuing computer science; I’ve always loved mathematics and computers, and experiences with various classes and clubs introduced me to the power and beauty of software engineering. But why am I drawn to AI rather than other subfields like distributed systems or programming language design?

Terror management theory suggests that a fear of death is at the core of our beliefs and behavior, both individually and collectively as a species. For many people, the finiteness of life is subconsciously repressed, but for me, it’s something I think about often. Ever since the sudden death of my mom in 2016, I’ve been painfully aware that life is short and can end without warning. To say that that experience devastated me would be an understatement. In the following year, my health suffered, my grades took a hit, and I struggled to find purpose. The track I was on, to graduate and work as a software engineer, no longer seemed so appealing, and while my peers earned internships at top tech companies, I took time off to spend time with family and introspect.

In spite of the short-term devastation, I was eventually able to extract value from the experience. As I rethought my career trajectory, I decided I needed to work on problems with more philosophical implications than normal software engineering. I began to consider deeply what it means to be human and started taking classes on cognitive science and philosophy of mind. I discovered the field of artificial intelligence, and the holy grail of artificial general intelligence struck me as a problem worth pursuing. While my ability to pursue knowledge and engineer computer systems is limited by my mortality, a generally intelligent computer system would not be limited in the same way and would have the potential to generate far greater discoveries than I could ever hope to. Through the field of AI, I found a way that I could build systems that could continue to improve the world even after I’m gone.

While I’m sure the motivations of AI researchers vary wildly, I’d wager many of us are drawn to the field because of its connection to fields like synthetic biology. The desire to engineer life is deep-seated in literature going back to the ancient Greeks, and we see in modern science fiction the portrayal of multigenerational generally intelligent robots. Digital assistants like Alexa are a small step toward this goal, and with new breakthroughs coming every year, we are slowly inching toward the dream of AGI. Whether we will get there in 100 years, or 500 years, or ever, nobody knows, but it’s a goal that I’m excited to spend my life pursuing, knowing that in the process I’ll have the opportunity to work with brilliant scientists and engineers to build systems that expand our knowledge of the universe and ourselves. Death still terrifies me, but to be alive at all to begin with is truly a miracle, and so if I can use my life to expand the scope of human knowledge even a tiny fraction, I believe I’ll be able to die happy.
